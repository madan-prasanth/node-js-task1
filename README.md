# node-js-task1 1.Create a Node.js server to implement routes
for /home, /about, and /contact that respond with
different messages for each route.
Explanation:
1. const express = require(express);
This line is attempting to import the Express library, but there's a small error. The require
function should take a string as an argument, so it should be require('express') with quotes.
Express is a web application framework for Node.js, which helps in building web applications
and APIs.

2. const app = express();
Here, you are creating an instance of an Express application by calling express().
The app variable represents your Express application and will be used to define routes and
middleware.

3. app.use(express.json());
This middleware allows the Express application to parse incoming requests with JSON
payloads.
It helps in handling JSON data sent in HTTP request bodies.

4. app.get('/', (req, res) => { res.send(This is main page); });
Defines a GET route for the root URL (/).
When someone accesses the root URL, the server will respond with the text This is main page.
Thereâ€™s a syntax error here as well: The string This is main page should be wrapped in quotes
like 'This is main page'.

5. app.get('/home', (req, res) => { res.send(I am from home page); });

Sets up a GET route at the /home URL.
When someone visits /home, the server responds with Iam from home page.
Again, Iam from home page should be wrapped in quotes.

6. app.get('/about', (req, res) => { res.send(I am a computer science and engineering
student); });
Sets up a GET route at the /about URL.
When someone visits /about, the server responds with Iam a computer science and engineering
student.
The response text should also be in quotes here.

7. app.get('/contact', (req, res) => { res.send('contact me on roogle.com'); });
Sets up a GET route at the /contact URL.
When /contact is accessed, the server sends back the text contact me on roogle.com.

8. app.get('/greet', (req, res) => { const name = req.query.name || guest; res.send(Hello,
${name}!); });
Defines a GET route at the /greet URL.
Retrieves a name parameter from the query string (e.g., /greet?name=John), with a default
value of guest if no name is provided.
Sends back Hello, ${name}!, with the name inserted into the response.
The variable guest and the string Hello, ${name}! should be in quotes ('guest' and `Hello,
${name}!` respectively).

9. port = process.env.PORT || 3069;
Sets the port variable to either the value from process.env.PORT (an environment variable) or
defaults to 3069 if process.env.PORT is not set.

10. app.listen(port, () => console.log(Port is running on ${port}));
Starts the server and listens on the specified port.
Logs a message to the console with the port number when the server is running.
The string Port is running on ${port} should be wrapped in backticks (`Port is running on
${port}`).

2.Build a server with a route /greet that accepts
a query parameter name and responds with a
personalized greeting message, e.g., &quot;Hello,
[name]!&quot;

1. const express = require('express');
Imports the Express module, which is a web framework for Node.js that simplifies the process of
creating web servers.

2. const app = express();
Creates an instance of an Express application. This app object will be used to define routes,
middleware, and other aspects of the server.

3. app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true }));
This line adds middleware to parse URL-encoded data, which is commonly used for HTML form
submissions.
The extended: true option allows the parsing of nested objects, typically generated by form data.

4. app.get('/', (req, res) => { ... });
Defines a GET route for the root URL (/).
When a client visits the root URL, it responds with an HTML form.

5-11. Inside the app.get('/', (req, res) => { ... }); block:
res.send(`
<form action="/greet" method="POST">
<label for="name">Enter your name:</label>
<input type="text" id="name" name="name">
<button type="submit">Greet me!</button>
</form>
`);
The res.send() function sends an HTML form back to the client.
This form has a text input field (<input type="text" id="name" name="name">) where users can
enter their name.
The form submits a POST request to the /greet endpoint when the "Greet me!" button is clicked,
using the method="POST" attribute.

12. app.post('/greet', (req, res) => { ... });
Defines a POST route for the /greet URL. This route will handle the form submission.
When the form is submitted, the server will receive the request and run this function.

13-14. Inside the app.post('/greet', (req, res) => { ... }); block:
const name = req.body.name || 'Guest';
res.send(`Hello, ${name}!`);
Extracts the name value from the form data (available in req.body thanks to the
express.urlencoded middleware).
If no name was provided in the form, it defaults to 'Guest'.

Sends a greeting back to the client using res.send() with the user's name injected into the
response using template literals.

15. const PORT = 3000;
Defines the port number (3000) on which the server will listen for incoming connections.

16-19. app.listen(PORT, () => { ... });
app.listen(PORT, () => {
console.log(`Server is running on http://localhost:${PORT}`);
});
Starts the server and tells it to listen for incoming requests on port 3000.
Once the server is running, it logs a message to the console with a link to the local server URL.
